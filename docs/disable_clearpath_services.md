# Clearpath provided services

Clearpath provides us with a couple of daemons which bring up the robot base, sensors, and autogenerates some code. We want to disable these services so we can have full control of the robot for customizations and additional bringup procedures. Note that the `colcon_ws` in the root directory is where some of the code here resides, but also in autogenerated sources. Thus, it is recommended **not to touch** the `colcon_ws` or `/etc/clearpath` directories such that it is possible to reactive these services in the future and restore a on-shipment configuration.

We can find the set of services running from clearpath via `sudo systemctl | grep clearpath` which should provide us with the following

```
administrator@cpr-j100-0849:~$ systemctl | grep clearpath
  clearpath-platform.service                                                                                                            loaded active running   "Clearpath robot sub-service, launch all platform nodes"
  clearpath-robot.service                                                                                                               loaded active running   "Clearpath robot main generation and bringup service"
  clearpath-sensors.service                                                                                                             loaded active running   "Clearpath robot sub-service, launch all sensor nodes"

```

We should stop these services via

```
sudo systemctl stop clearpath-platform.service
sudo systemctl stop clearpath-sensors.service
sudo systemctl stop clearpath-robot.service
```

The same can be done to permanently disable them so they do not startup on hardware boot

```
sudo systemctl disable clearpath-platform.service
sudo systemctl disable clearpath-sensors.service
sudo systemctl disable clearpath-robot.service
```

These can be later `enable`d or `start`ed up again, as desired.
